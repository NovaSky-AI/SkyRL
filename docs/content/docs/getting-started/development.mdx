## Pre-requisities

Follow the [installation guide](installation). Make sure that the installation works with our [quick start example](quickstart).

## Modifying the code

**Adding a new environment or task?**
Follow the [new task tutorial](../tutorials/new_env). Your custom code can be placed anywhere - building on top of `skyrl` as a package - but we recommend structuring it as a folder similar to `examples/multiply`.

**Creating a custom Generator (ex: porting an agent harness, implementing custom trajectory generation logic, etc.)?**
Same as the above: your custom code can be placed anywhere and we typically use `examples/train/` for this. See `examples/mini_swe_agent` for an example of creating a custom `Generator` for [Mini-SWE-Agent](https://github.com/SWE-agent/mini-swe-agent).

**Looking to add a new algorithm by changing your advantage estimator or policy loss?**
Follow the guide for [implementing custom algorithms](../algorithms/custom_algorithms). See `examples/algorithms` for examples of various custom algorithm implementations.

**Looking to modify the training loop for full control?**
Follow the guide for [creating a custom trainer](../algorithms/custom_algorithms#creating-a-custom-trainer). See `examples/algorithms/dapo/main_dapo.py` for an example of how to modify the Trainer class for DAPO.

**Modifying the existing environment code (ex: adding a custom method for all Env classes, improving the SearchEnv implementation)?**
You would modify the code in [skyrl-gym](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL/tree/main/skyrl-gym/). Note: you do **not** have to modify the `skyrl-gym` package for adding a new environment or task. 

## Contributing to SkyRL

We welcome all forms of contributions to SkyRL, including bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, code contributions etc. 

## Testing

For code contributions, we recommend running unit tests before submitting a pull request. Unless otherwise specified, all commands below should be run from the repository root.

### CPU tests

```bash
# SkyRL core (includes Tinker and Jax backend tests)
uv run --extra tinker --extra jax --extra dev pytest --forked -s tests \
  --ignore=tests/tx/gpu --ignore=tests/train --ignore=tests/backends/skyrl_train

# FSDP and Megatron backend
uv run --isolated --extra skyrl-train --extra dev pytest tests/train/ tests/backends/skyrl_train/ \
  --ignore=tests/backends/skyrl_train/gpu
```

### GPU tests

The GPU tests require a node with at least 8 GPUs. They have been tested on 8xH100 nodes, but should work on 8xA100 nodes as well. We are actively working on making these more accessible.

The FSDP and Megatron backend tests assume that the GSM8K dataset is downloaded to `~/data/gsm8k`. If you have not downloaded the dataset, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
uv run --isolated examples/train/gsm8k/gsm8k_dataset.py --output_dir ~/data/gsm8k
```

#### Jax backend

```bash
uv run --extra gpu --extra tinker --extra dev pytest tests/tx/gpu
```

#### FSDP backend

```bash
uv run --isolated --extra dev --extra fsdp pytest -s tests/backends/skyrl_train/gpu/gpu_ci -m "not (integrations or megatron)"
```

#### Megatron backend

```bash
uv run --isolated --extra dev --extra megatron pytest -s tests/backends/skyrl_train/gpu/gpu_ci -m "megatron"
```

### SkyRL-Gym

You can run the tests for the `skyrl-gym` package by running the following command:

```bash
cd skyrl-gym
uv run --isolated --extra dev pytest tests/
```

## Linting and Formatting

We use pre-commit hooks to automatically lint and format the code. You can install the pre-commit hooks by running the following command:

```bash
uv pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

```

If you wish to manually run linting and formatting:

```bash
bash format.sh # run from the root directory

```

## Documentation

We welcome contributions to the documentation. The documentation is stored in the `docs/` folder and uses [fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/). 

### Developing locally

We recommend building the documentation locally to preview your changes.

```bash
cd docs
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
