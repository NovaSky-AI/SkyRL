Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO)
==============================================================

The `DAPO <https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14476>`_ algorithm consists of the following components:
- **Clip-Higher**: Promotes the diversity of the system and avoids entropy collapse;
- **Dynamic Sampling**: Improves training efficiency and stability;
- **Token-Level Policy Gradient Loss**: Critical in long-CoT RL scenarios;
- **Overlong Reward Shaping**: Reduces reward noise and stabilizes training.
